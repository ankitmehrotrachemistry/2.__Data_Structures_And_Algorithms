𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 is a bottom up technique in which the smaller subproblems are solved first and the result of these are sued to find the solution of the 
larger sub-problems.

𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀:

1. Optimal Substructure: An optimal solution constructed from the optimal solutions of its sub-problems.
2. Overlapping Sub-problems: While calculating the optimal solution of subproblems same computation is repeated repeatedly.
