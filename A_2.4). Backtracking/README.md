𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 is a method by which solution is found by exhaustively searching through large but finite number of states, with some pruning or bounding function, 
we can narrow down our search.

For all the problems (like NP hard problems) for which there does not exist any other efficient algorithm we use backtracking algorithm.
