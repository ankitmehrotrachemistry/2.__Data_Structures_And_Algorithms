𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘆 𝗮𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺𝘀 are generally used to solve optimization problems. In greedy algorithm, solution is constructed through a sequence of steps. At each step, choice is made which is locally optimal.

𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀:

1. Greedy choice: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
2. Optimal substructure: An optimal solution to the problem is made from optimal solutions of sub-problems.
